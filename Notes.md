# Notes

Python Notes:
- Truthy values are values that evaluate to True in a boolean context
- Falsey values are values that evaluate to False in a boolean context
- Falsey values include empty sequences (lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, sets), zero in every numeric type, None, and False
- Truthy values include non-empty sequences, numbers (except 0 in every numeric type), and basically every value that is not falsey
